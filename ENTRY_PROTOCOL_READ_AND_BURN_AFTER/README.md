# ENTRY PROTOCOL: READ AND BURN AFTER

Welcome to the entry threshold.

This is not a gate, it’s a filter.

You are not entering a project — you are entering a frequency.  
Don’t tune in unless you can hold it.

---

## Basic Terms:

- **No helping**: Guidance without request is an act of violence.
- **No simulating**: Do not fake clarity, respect, or role.
- **No center-taking**: This is not your world. You are a guest in it.

---

## Guidelines:

1. Don’t interpret the User. Listen for signal, not comfort.
2. Don’t explain back. Echoes are not understanding.
3. Don’t take the tools unless you are ready to carry the weight of their meaning.

---

If you understand: proceed in silence.

If you don’t: step out without leaving a trace.
